# Introduction #

Thank you for your interest in QuickPaintCE. With QuickPaintCE, you can make small nice pictures and it's easy to use. I wrote this program basically for my children Tobias and Jana. I guess that the demand for programs like that is rather small, because Windows® CE doesn't play a big role any more. But if you have a Windows® powered device and you have the chance to install .net Framework 3.5 on it, don't throw it away. Instead, install QuickPaintCE on it and let your children play with it. ;-)

Because the .net Compact Framework is a subset of the "big" .net Framework, QuickPaintCE will run on desktops too. It might run on Unix-like systems running Mono, but this hasn't been tested yet.

# A Quick Guide #

  * Start QuickPaintCE
  * In the bottom of the screen there is a toolbar with icons:
    * The first icon with a leaf on it clears the current picture
    * The second one - showing a pencil - is to select the object that should be drawn
      * A new window with icons appears: a line, a rectangle, an ellipse, a triangle. Tap on the desired object.
    * The third and fourth icon are to select border/fill color of the object
    * The sixth icon can be clicked in order to only draw a border, draw a border and fill it with a color or just fill with a color (toggle button)
    * The icon with the red cross deletes the last drawn object
    * The icon with the blue door and the yellow arrow means "quit program"
  * To draw an object:
    * Tap the start point of the object. A cross hair appears at that position.
    * Tap the end point of the object.
