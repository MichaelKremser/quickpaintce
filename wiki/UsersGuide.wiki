#summary User's Guide - How To Use QuickPaintCE

= Introduction =

Thank you for your interest in QuickPaintCE. With QuickPaintCE, you can make small nice pictures and it's easy to use. I wrote this program basically for my children Tobias and Jana. I guess that the demand for programs like that is rather small, because Windows® CE doesn't play a big role any more. But if you have a Windows® powered device and you have the chance to install .net Framework 3.5 on it, don't throw it away. Instead, install QuickPaintCE on it and let your children play with it. ;-)

= A Quick Guide =

* Start QuickPaintCE
* In the bottom of the screen there is a toolbar with icons:
** The first icons clears the current picture
** The second one is to select the object that should be drawn
** The third and fourth one are to select border/fill color of the object
** The sixth icon can be clicked in order to only draw a border, draw a border and fill it with a color or just fill with a color (toggle button)
** The icon with the red cross deletes the last drawn object
** The icon with the blue door and the yellow arrow means "quit program"
* To draw an object:
** Tap the start point of the object. An cross hair appears at that position.
** Tap the end point of the object.
